Description:
• Our TAP N SOLVE puzzle app allows the player to solve numbered sliding puzzle.

• The player may choose to sign in using his/her Google account.

• The player can choose the difficulty level which will be set based on the puzzle dimensions (3 x 3 [Easy], 4 x 4 [Medium], 5 x 5[Hard]).

• The player also has a choice between two modes:
	• Normal
		• A timer is started as soon as the player begins the game.
	• Timed
		• Depending on the difficulty level chosen, a countdown timer is started as soon as the player begins the game.
		• Time Limit: Easy - 05:00 mins, Medium - 10:00 mins, Hard - 15:00 mins
		• If the player fails to solve the puzzle within the stipulated time, appropriate message is displayed and he/she is given the choice to replay or go to the main menu.

• The player also has options to pause/resume the game and reset/shuffle the tiles.

• In either modes, the number of moves made by the player is also recorded. Once solved, the player is shown his/her score calculated based on the time taken and number of moves to complete the puzzle.

• If the player is signed in, he/she can publish his/her score to the leaderboard which is accessible from the main menu.
